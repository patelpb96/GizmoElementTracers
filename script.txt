analysis:
    01-gizmo_analysis
        We will first set up the default analysis software.
        This software is referenced at the end of the data release reference paper.
        You are welcome to use alternatives, but the suggested analysis software will make starting out much easier.
        This software will work on both local and remote computers.
    02-clone
        To install the software you must be able to use command line, i.e. enter commands into a terminal.
        All modern computers, including supercomputers, should have this capability.
        If you do not know how to use command line, please see the linked resources, or ask a peer or mentor.
        Move to your dedicated analysis folder and enter the following command to retrieve the analysis software.
        git clone git@bitbucket.org:awetzel/gizmo_analysis.git
        If you get an error, or do not know what git is, please see the linked resources.
    03-install
        Once cloned, install the software by entering the following command: `bash ./gizmo_analysis/install_helper.sh`.
        This will install gizmo_analysis, the primary analysis package, as well as its dependencies.
    04-installation_check
        After installation, your analysis directory should look like this.
        In the analysis directory you will find the simulation directory, the gizmo_analysis directory containing most of the analysis code,
            as well as the primary dependency for gizmo_analysis, halo_analysis.
        The rest are folders created as part of the installation.
    05-the_tutorials
        We will open up the python tutorial notebooks with jupyterlab.
        There are two tutorial notebooks that are included as part of gizmo_analysis.
        A minimal tutorial, designed to help you open simulation data as quickly and simply as possible,
            and a much more in-depth tutorial notebook, useful as a reference.
        We will go through the minimal tutorial notebook.
    06-loading_the_data
        The first step is loading the data.
        If your directory structure is setup as we showed earlier then gizmo_analysis will handle this for you.
    07-a_simple_plot
    08-a_simple_projected_plot
